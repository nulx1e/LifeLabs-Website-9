      <p>According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), as of December 18, the death toll from Pablo had reached 1,046 people with 841 still missing, and damages to agriculture reaching $398 million, infrastructure $190.4 million, and private property $1.2 million. The affected areas were usually the coastal and low-lying areas where the storm surge occurred. The geographical location of the area affected the severity of the damage, as coastal areas are most vulnerable to the storm surge and high winds caused by the storm.In terms of economic status, the effect of the typhoon was also felt in terms of the potential damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings, which can impact the area's economic output.</p>

      <p>The community was severely affected by Typhoon Pablo, with massive rainfall, landslides, flooding, and wind damages occurring in large portions of the Philippines. This led to severe infrastructural damage and widespread displacement of people. Even after the typhoon, the lack of power, food, water, and loss of homes affected most Filipinos.</p>

      <p>The community was not really prepared for the typhoon, considering the casualties it made. They were given relief goods provided by the government, and other countries donated money to help rebuild and repair damaged homes.</p>
